Codes and data for "Making waves: Comparative analysis of gene drive spread characteristics in a continuous space model".

In the Data Process Code folder, you can find the data process data we used for this study.
"Method_Raw_Data.py" is used to get the accurate wave speed for each simulation in bulk.
"Method_Average_Test.py" is used to get the average wave speed in bulk.

In the Raw Data folder, we added all the raw data that we used to plot the figures in this study.

In the SLiM Simulation Code folder, we put all the slim scripts we used.
One thing to note for these is that even though some codes are very similar to each other, there are often some small differences between them.
We have wrote the name of gene drive we simulated for each script.
