Determinstic model is on Excel.
Panmictic models are on SLiM 4.0.
Visualizing Data by R 4.2.2.

###Determinstic model (Fig.6a):
Deterministic, discrete-generation model framework assess genetic load of RIDD system, SIT, fsRIDL and fsRIDL with drive.

###Panmictic general model (Fig.6b-i):
Panmictic, overlapping-generation model framework simulate RIDD-drive system, RIDD-split, SIT and fsRIDL at different drive conversion rate and release ratio.

###Panmictic cage model (Fig.5):
Panmictic, overlapping-generation model framework simulate the cages. 
Adapted from general model for RIDD-spilt system, but with ecological parameter adjusted. 

###Panmictic migration model(Sup Fig.6c):
Panmictic, overlapping-generation model framework simulate two demes linked by unidirectional migration (from target deme to neighbor deme). 
Adapted from general model for RIDD-full system

###Panmictic self-limiying model(Sup Fig.6ab):
Panmictic, overlapping-generation model framework simulate the situation of RIDD system stop release.
Adapted from general model for RIDD-full and RIDD-split.

###R codes:
simulation_selflimiting.R and simulation_cage.R generate line chart to show population dynamics.
heatmap_general.R and heatmap_migration.R generate heatmaps to show predication parameters.

### data:
Data generated by the above frameworks and used for visualization.
