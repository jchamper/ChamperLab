To calculate the mean and standard error (SE), all data are merged into a single csv file, and the "Batch Analysis MeanSEMP.r" script should be executed. Both files should be in the same folder.

For p-value calculations using a z-test, comparison groups are organized into separate independent CSV files. The "Batch Analysis PValue Different Groups.r" script should then used for analysis.

The csv file should always be named "combined.csv". Provided csv files with different names should be renamed before use.
