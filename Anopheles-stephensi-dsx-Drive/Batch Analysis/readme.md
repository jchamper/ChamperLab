To calculate the mean and standard error (SE), all data are merged into a single file named combined.csv, and the Batch Analysis MeanSEMP.r script is executed.

For p-value calculations using a z-test, comparison groups are organized into separate independent CSV files. The Batch Analysis PValue Different Groups.r script is then used for analysis.
