# Code and data for "Adversarial interspecies relationships facilitate population suppression by gene drive in spatially explicit models".

Note: The SLiM code in this paper wrote in SLiM version 3.

## 1 - Generic model

All the discrete-generation models we used could be found in this generic folder.

## 2 - Two region model

The scripts in this folder are used to model different species are specialized to certain region, including discrete-generation model and mosquito specific model.

## 3 - Mosquito specific model

Mosquito competition model and mosquito predation model could be found in this folder.

## 4 - Seasonal model

All seasonal models could be found in this folder, including strong seasonal change (linear transition between maximum and minimum levels) and weak seasonal change (varied according to a sinusoidal function).

## 5 - Raw data

All raw data used for making the plots could be found in the data folder.
